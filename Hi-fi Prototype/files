High-fidelity prototype (HFP) exploration (teams should produce one fully-interactive high-fidelity prototype in Figma/Penpot. The HFP should explore responsive design (mobile and desktop look and feel) as well as imagery, colour, type, and fully interactive "points & clicks."Ensure you provide the XD/Figma files as well as a PDF output of the HFP
Ensure you link design ideas back to a minimum of three topics discussed in class relating to people-centred design (affordances, gestalt, constraints, etc.). Document these in a 1-page PDF (with screenshots/images as necessary)
Create a formative usability questionnaire of 5-10 user tasks as based on your high-fidelity prototype creation(s) that you would like to test with users and get feedback on.
A 1-2 page (PDF) document providing a discussion and analysis of usability data collected from the "Yanky-ish swap team usability session." Ensure to provide your team's response to how you will address comments/data obtained in the evolution of your design
Summarized customer notes from customer check-ins (2-page maximum)
Updated user story map, if required (regardless, ensure to do a PDF export from StoriesOnBoard) with envisioned MVPs as a snapshot of changes/no changes)
